# Modeling time series with Seasonal ARIMA to predict upscaling breaches

Extract information from load balancers with `elb-request-count.py` python script. This will generate a csv of data to perform the analysis on

```bash
./elb-request-count.py -l elb-id elb-id2 ..
```

Establish if timeseries is stationary, build seasional ARIMA model and predict!
